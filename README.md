## Scala Styling Guide

We use [Scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/) to format our code. Use the following config in your projects:

```
version = 3.3.1

runner.dialect                  = scala213source3
style                           = defaultWithAlign
maxColumn                       = 120
includeCurlyBraceInSelectChains = false
danglingParentheses.preset      = true
lineEndings                     = preserve
trailingCommas                  = always

continuationIndent {
  callSite = 2
  defnSite = 2
}

newlines {
  penalizeSingleSelectMultiArgList = false
  alwaysBeforeElseAfterCurlyIf     = true
}

project {
  git = true
  excludeFilters = [
    target/
  ]
}

binPack {
  parentConstructors = true
}

rewrite {
  rules = [RedundantParens, SortImports, PreferCurlyFors]
}

align {
  preset                   = most
  arrowEnumeratorGenerator = true
  tokens."+"               = [":=", "+=", "++="]
  openParenCallSite        = false
}
```

## Python Styling Guide

Use the following pre-commit hooks:

- isort
- pylint following [Google styling guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
- black formater with the following flags:
  - `-l 110 -S -t`
  - VSCode settings.json

```json
"python.formatting.blackArgs": ["-l", "110", "-S", "-t"]
```

- flake8

- docstrings: [Google conventions](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
- Quotes: `double`
- mypy
- Use pre-commit with the following hooks:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v2.2.3
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: debug-statements
      - id: requirements-txt-fixer
      - id: flake8

  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
    rev: v0.720
    hooks:
      - id: mypy
        args: [--allow-redefinition, --ignore-missing-imports]

  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: isort
        name: "Sort imports"
        language: system
        types: [file, python]
        entry: isort
      - id: pylint
        name: "PyLint"
        language: system
        types: [file, python]
        files: .
        exclude: test_*.py
        entry: python3 -m pylint
      - id: black
        name: "Black"
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
        entry: black .
        args: [--safe, --quiet, "--line-length=110", "--skip-string-normalization"]
```

## Naming Conventions

### Git Branch Naming

Your branch name should follow the format¬†type-scope.

Types:

- feat
- fix
- chore

### Storage buckets, i.e. s3, gcs

```
ai.priceloop.{{bucket_purpose}}.{{environment}}
```

e.g. `ai.priceloop.data.prod`

`{{environment}} = {prod, stage}`

`{{bucket_purpose}}` can potentially be broken down to

`{{layer}}.{{bucket_purpose}}`, e.g.

```
ai.priceloop.ml.metadata
ai.priceloop.frontend.assets
ai.priceloop.dataplatform.metadata
```

### Namespace

- Long: priceloop-production / priceloop-staging

- Short: priceloop-prod / priceloop-stage

## Git Commit Structure

- Be descriptive
- Use all lower-case
- Limit punctuations (no dots, no commas)
- Include one of the specified types
  - docs: Documentation only changes
  - feat: A new feature
  - fix: A bug fix
  - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
  - chore: updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change
- Short (under 70 characters is best)
- In general, follow the¬†[Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)¬†guidelines

üëâ Follow the git commit structure for commits that are getting merged. In branches, when you do something temporary (e.g. testing ideas etc), you don't need to follow it

## Git Branch Flow

We follow the following PRs flow with user facing feature(s):

```
develop ‚Üí { git checkout -b } ‚Üí feature branch ‚Üí {PR} develop ‚Üí {PR} master
```

### CI/CD

We use Github Actions as the CI solution. Every repository with the codebase for user facing features must contain the following CI configuration/workflow definition files:

```bash
.github
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ develop.yaml
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ master.yaml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pr_branches_check.yaml
```

Where

- `develop.yaml` - defines the CI pipeline to deploy to the stage env
- `master.yaml` - defines the CI pipeline to deploy to the prod env
- `pr_branches_check.yaml` - defines the check to validate if PR is compliant with the branch flow

pr_branches_check.yaml

```yaml
name: PR Branches Check

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - reopened

jobs:
  develop_to_master:
    if: github.base_ref == 'master'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check if PR to "master" is from "develop"
        if: ${{ github.head_ref != 'develop' }}
        run: |
          echo "Wrong source branch, only develop->master PR's allowed"
          exit 1
  any_to_develop:
    if: github.base_ref == 'develop'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check if PR is to "develop"
        if: ${{ github.head_ref == 'refs/heads/master' }}
        run: |
          echo "Wrong source branch, only "!master"->develop PR's allowed"
          exit 1
```

### GitHub Branches Protection Rules

Every Github repository containing user facing features must have the protection rules for the `master` and `develop` branches.

## Secrets

‚ö†Ô∏è Never put any username, password on Git, always use local environments or secrets manager to access services

- Metadata considered as secrets:
  - AWS keys (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
  - Access tokens (any oauth2 tokens which have long life time)
  - Access credentials, i.e. combination of password and user name
  - Webhook URLs
- Metadata which can be stored to git:
  - Bucket name, path to object
  - Database name
  - Resource ID, URI ‚Üê it may be a subject of change/dispute

Note: in case of doubt whether the info is a secret/internal or can be public, treat it at a higher security level, i.e. as a secret. It costs nothing to downgrade security level, but it's quite expensive to upgrade it üòÉ

### How to share secrets

To share between peers:

- Please use [gpg](https://gnupg.org/) to encrypt opaque text secret.
- Slack DM is acceptable, but remember to delete the secret message after it was received!

We use [AWS Secret Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) and [github secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) for secrets to be used programmatically.

## Language

- Stick to American English e.g. optimize instead of optimise or behavior instead of behaviour. In doubt check Google üòÉ

## License

- For private repos, no License necessary
- For public repos, we should use [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)
